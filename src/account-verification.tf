# Account Verification
#
# Verifies that Terraform is executing in the correct target AWS account by comparing the current
# AWS account ID against the expected account ID based on the component's context (tenant-stage).
#
# How it works:
# 1. Constructs the expected account name from context variables (format: "tenant-stage")
# 2. Looks up the expected account ID from the account_map
# 3. Validates that current account ID matches expected account ID
# 4. Fails with a clear error message if accounts don't match
#
# Note: Validation only occurs when account_verification_enabled is true, the account_map is
# populated, and the expected account name can be constructed from tenant and stage variables.

  # 2. account_map is provided and not empty
