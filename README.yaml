# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This component is responsible for provisioning CloudTrail auditing in an individual AWS account. It's expected to be used alongside
  [the `cloudtrail-bucket` component](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/main/modules/cloudtrail-bucket)
  as it utilizes that bucket via remote state.

  This component can either be deployed selectively to various accounts with `is_organization_trail=false`, or
  alternatively created in all accounts if deployed to the management account with `is_organization_trail=true`.

  ## Component Features

  - **Organization Trail**: Supports organization-wide trail from the management account
  - **CloudWatch Integration**: CloudWatch Logs integration with configurable retention
  - **KMS Encryption**: Optional KMS key encryption for CloudTrail logs
  - **Multi-Region Trail**: Supports creating trails across all AWS regions
  - **Account Verification**: Optional safety check that validates Terraform is running in the correct AWS account
  - **Flexible Account Map**: Supports both remote-state account-map lookups and static account map variables (default)

  **Stack Level**: Global

  The following is an example snippet for how to use this component:

  (`gbl-root.yaml`)

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      cloudtrail:
        vars:
          enabled: true
          cloudtrail_bucket_environment_name: "ue1"
          cloudtrail_bucket_stage_name: "audit"
          cloudwatch_logs_retention_in_days: 730
          is_organization_trail: true
  ```
